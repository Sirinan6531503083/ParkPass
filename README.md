# Digital Stamp Collection â€“ Explore Thai National Parks

A digital stamp book app to **collect and preserve memories from visiting national parks across Thailand**. Every park you visit can leave a "digital stamp" in your virtual book, making your travel experiences more fun and memorable.

## About
This app encourages travel within Thailand's beautiful national parks while keeping memories in a **modern, eco-friendly, digital format**. Perfect for travelers, students, and nature enthusiasts.

## Why This Project 
People often forget their physical park journals, which prevents them from collecting stamps. **ParkPass** provides a digital solution, allowing users to:

- Collect stamps easily
- Track their visits
- Enjoy a seamless and convenient experience without worrying about losing the journal


## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React / Vue / Flutter (adjust based on your implementation)
- Backend: Firebase / Node.js (if applicable)
- Database: Firestore / Realtime Database (optional)
- Deployment: Web / Mobile


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
